# When I Am A Leader

I find myself often wanting to write down thoughts and ideas to store for a later time. Especially about things I may or may not want to do as I rise as a front end engineer. Because I'm really bad about keeping a consistent journal or using other note-taking tools, I figure a repository is the best place to keep these ideas. This also comes with the benefit of being open source, so great ideas from the community can be submitted as PRs. I think it might be a great way for developers to think about and shape the leaders they are becoming.

## Contributing

As with any open source project, PRs are welcome. Since this is "When _I_ am a Leader" and not "When _You_ are a Leader", I may not merge all PRs. It doesn't mean it's not a good idea, just perhaps one that doesn't fit my personal philosophy of leadership. That's ok. Not all leaders should be the same.

I also encourage you to fork this repository and adopt it as your own. Build up your own collection of ideas.

### Interviewing and Hiring

* If a take home assignment is used to assess a candidate's technical skill, a deadline and time allotment should be established at the time of assignment. The deadline should be reasonably ample to accommodate for busy schedules, but the time allotment _should_ be short, and preferably slightly less than is required for completing the assignment fully. Preferably, it should be less than 4 hours (a half day's work is not a small amount of work if someone is already working a full time job). Be firm about this allotment. Failing to complete the assignment helps to understand how the candidate prioritizes tasks in a time crunch. This will also help you discern whether the candidate prefers to opt for quantity versus quality, grand architecture versus details, etc.

### Managing

* Strive for more 1:1s than seem necessary at first. Over time you can adjust. Team connection is important. Prefer sticking to 1:1 schedule over deadlines. There is always more code to write, but if coders quit, there aren't people to write that code.
* Be ruthless about meeting efficiency. Encourage break out meetings, frequent breaks, and other means of allowing for tangential topics and impromptu social interactions. Be respectful of people's time in meetings. Do **not** fall in to the trap of having meetings where everyone updates you, but has little need to update each other. Have them reach out to you individually through email or Slack for that update. If necessary, reach out to them. Let your workers work.
* Remain cognizant that others don't think like you, don't respond to the same stimuli you do, don't have the same goals as you. Treat the individuals on your team for what they are--*unique*. Learn what motivates them, what doesn't, what they want from their job, etc.
